## Objective
This project aims to analyze the energy consumption patterns and CO2 emissions at the Korea Electric Power Corporation, one of the largest steel industries in South Korea. Through various visualizations, we seek to understand how electricity usage fluctuates over time, considering different factors such as weekdays, hours, load types, and seasons. Additionally, the analysis explores the environmental impact of the company's operations, reflected in its CO2 emissions.
By doing so, we intend to provide a detailed view of how the industry consumes energy in different contexts and how these consumption patterns influence greenhouse gas emissions. The graphs help transform raw data into clear and informative stories, supporting the planning of energy efficiency initiatives and the sustainable management of resources.

## Data

The data used for this analysis includes:
- Electricity usage (kWh): The primary metric to quantify the amount of electricity used by the company in different scenarios.
- Reactive Power (Lagging and Leading Current kVarh): Evaluates electrical performance and system efficiency under different operating conditions.
- Power Factor (Lagging and Leading Current): Measures energy efficiency by comparing the actual power consumed with the total power used by the plant.
- CO2 Emissions (tCO2): Estimates the carbon dioxide emissions generated by energy consumption.
- Load Type: Classifies industrial operations into three load types—Light, Medium, and Maximum—providing insights into the impact of different operational levels on energy use and efficiency.
- Hour, weekday, month, and seasons: Temporal variables used to investigate how consumption and emissions vary across different time periods.
